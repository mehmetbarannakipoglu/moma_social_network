This project, created for the INF6018 Social Media Analytics class, explores the exhibition network of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) from 1940 to 1970. It examines how participant connections, gender, and nationality shaped the network's structure using advanced network analysis techniques and the Leiden community detection algorithm. The analysis reveals key patterns of interconnectedness, disparities, and clustering based on demographic attributes. The repository contains cleaned datasets, R scripts, visualizations, and metrics to support the findings and facilitate further exploration.
